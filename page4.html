            <p>
              ADHD refers to all forms of attention deficit hyperactivity
              disorder, including those types that don’t involve
              "hyperactivity." Essentially, someone can be diagnosed with ADHD
              and have zero hyperactivity or impulsive tendencies. The bottom
              line with all types of ADHD is that there are biological
              differences in the brain: slower brain development in childhood,
              less blood flow to the area of the brain that’s responsible for
              planning, task initiation, memorizing, and other executive
              functions, and a dysregulation of the dopamine system. As a
              result, individuals with an ADHD brain may behave and learn
              differently than those with a non-ADHD brain.

              <h3>There’s No One Set of Symptoms for ADHD</h3> There are some
              similarities between people with ADHD, but the reality is, every
              individual is unique, and not everyone will have obvious symptoms.
              This is why it’s important to get a professional evaluation if you
              think you or your child may have ADHD rather than making
              assumptions. With an assessment conducted by a licensed
              psychologist, you can start moving forward with the tools and
              treatment that will enable you to thrive.

             Results are usually received within 1 business days, though sometimes it may take longer depending on the psychologist's workload.
